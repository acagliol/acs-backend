# Terraform Backend Infrastructure Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for setting up a company-wide Terraform backend infrastructure for Google Cloud. The goal is to create a scalable, secure, and efficient codebase that supports multiple developers while protecting production environments using a **single Terraform configuration** that dynamically loads environment-specific settings.

## Implementation Note: Environment Configuration Deviation

**Current Implementation:**

- The project currently uses a single `config/environments.json` file containing configuration for all environments (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
- This is a deviation from the original plan, which called for separate JSON files for each environment in the `environments/` directory (e.g., `environments/dev.json`).
- All scripts and Terraform code reference this centralized file for environment-specific settings.
- The plan and documentation will be updated to reflect this current implementation.

## Architecture Overview

### Single Configuration, Multiple Environments
- **One Terraform Configuration**: `main.tf` contains all resource definitions
- **Dynamic Environment Loading**: Environment-specific settings loaded from JSON files
- **Conditional Resource Creation**: Resources created based on environment requirements
- **Centralized State Management**: Each environment uses separate state files in GCS

### Environment Configuration Files
Each environment has a JSON configuration file (`environments/{env}.json`) containing:
- Project ID and region settings
- Resource specifications (machine types, disk sizes, etc.)
- Feature flags (monitoring, backup, high availability)
- Network configurations
- Instance counts and scaling parameters

### Dynamic Deployment Process
1. **Environment Selection**: Specify target environment via variable
2. **Configuration Loading**: Terraform reads environment-specific JSON file
3. **Resource Creation**: Resources created with environment-specific settings
4. **State Management**: State stored in environment-specific GCS bucket

## Admin vs Developer Capabilities

### Admin Capabilities
- Project creation and management
- IAM role assignments
- Billing configuration
- Organization-level policies
- Production environment management
- Service account creation and management
- Network and security policy configuration

### Developer Capabilities
- Resource creation within existing projects
- Environment-specific deployments (dev/staging only)
- Configuration management via JSON files
- Resource scaling and updates
- Monitoring and logging configuration

## Production Protection Strategy

### Code-Level Protection
- Production resources have `prevent_destroy` lifecycle rules
- SSH access restricted to specific IP addresses in production
- Required manual confirmation for production deployments
- Branch protection rules for production branch

### Access Control
- Separate service accounts for each environment
- Production service account requires admin approval
- Branch protection rules for production branch
- Required code reviews for production changes
- Multi-factor authentication for production access

## Google Cloud Deployment Strategy

### Project Structure
```
Google Cloud Organization
├── terraform-admin-project (Admin only)
│   ├── IAM management
│   ├── Billing configuration
│   └── Organization policies
├── terraform-dev-project (Developers)
│   ├── Development resources
│   ├── Testing infrastructure
│   └── Development databases
├── terraform-staging-project (Developers)
│   ├── Staging resources
│   ├── Pre-production testing
│   └── Staging databases
└── terraform-prod-project (Admin only)
    ├── Production resources
    ├── Live databases
    └── Production monitoring
```

### Deployment Flow

#### Development Environment
- **Access**: Developers can deploy directly
- **Project**: Uses `terraform-dev-project`
- **Automation**: Fully automated via CI/CD
- **Approval**: No approval required
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback on failure

#### Staging Environment
- **Access**: Developers with approval
- **Project**: Uses `terraform-staging-project`
- **Automation**: Automated via CI/CD
- **Approval**: Requires pull request approval
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback on failure

#### Production Environment
- **Access**: Admin only
- **Project**: Uses `terraform-prod-project`
- **Automation**: Manual deployment only
- **Approval**: Requires admin approval
- **Rollback**: Manual rollback process

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Create project directory structure
2. Set up separate Google Cloud projects
3. Configure service accounts and IAM roles
4. Set up remote state management in GCS
5. Configure state locking and encryption

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration
1. Create environment-specific JSON configurations
2. Set up separate state files per environment
3. Configure backend configurations
4. Create deployment scripts
5. Set up CI/CD pipelines for dev and staging

### Phase 3: Security Implementation
1. Implement IAM policies and access controls
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Configure audit logging
4. Add security scanning and validation
5. Create backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
1. Design production architecture
2. Create production deployment procedures
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Document operational procedures
5. Conduct security audits

## Security Considerations

### State Management
- Remote state storage in GCS with encryption at rest
- State locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- Separate state files per environment
- Regular state backups
- Access logging for state operations

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Service account rotation
- Regular access reviews
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Audit logging for all operations

### Code Quality
- Terraform validation and formatting
- Security scanning with Checkov or similar tools
- Policy enforcement with OPA (Open Policy Agent)
- Regular dependency updates
- Code review requirements

## Monitoring and Observability

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking
- Cost monitoring and alerts
- Performance metrics
- Security event monitoring
- Compliance reporting

### Deployment Monitoring
- Deployment success/failure tracking
- Rollback monitoring
- Change impact analysis
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Modularize reusable components
- Version control all configurations
- Document all modules and resources
- Regular code reviews

### Deployment Practices
- Use blue-green deployments where possible
- Implement gradual rollouts
- Monitor deployments in real-time
- Have rollback procedures ready
- Test deployments in staging first

### Security Practices
- Regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use secrets management
- Implement least privilege access
- Regular backup testing

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Plan for multi-region deployments
- Consider global load balancing
- Design for auto-scaling
- Plan for disaster recovery
- Consider hybrid cloud scenarios

### Maintenance
- Regular infrastructure updates
- Performance optimization
- Cost optimization
- Security updates
- Documentation updates

## Conclusion

This plan provides a solid foundation for a secure, scalable, and maintainable Terraform backend infrastructure using a single configuration approach. The dynamic environment loading, combined with production protection measures, ensures that the infrastructure can be safely managed by multiple team members while protecting critical production environments.

The phased implementation approach allows for gradual adoption and testing, while the comprehensive security and monitoring strategies ensure that the infrastructure remains secure and observable as it scales.
